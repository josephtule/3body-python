The intent of this project is to create a 3-body simulator that will eventually 


## Equations of Motion
Using the Earth as the central body in an ECI reference frame, the equations of motion can be represented as the following:
$$ \ddot{\vec{r}}_ES = -$$

Where the subscripts represent a vector from the first element (E - Earth, M - Moon, S - Spacecraft) to the second element.
